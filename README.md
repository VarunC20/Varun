## Hi! I am Varun Chavan

I am a Mechanical Engineer who is venturing in the field of robotics. Currently I am working as a Project Assistant at SysIDEA Robotics Lab in IIT Gandhinagar.

### About

With the naïve aim of making space probes and satellites, I went for Engineering after 10th like others. At first, I was skeptical but as time passed, I started loving this field. I did my Diploma in Mechanical Engineering and then moved to Pune for my bachelors. Although not a robotics guy, I surely love building machines. I built an inexpensive semi-automated seed and fertilizer sowing bicycle for farmers and inspired by ISRO's Pragyan rover built a delivery robot named & 'ATAV'; as my final year project. This project led me to become more curious about Robotics and landed me here at SysIDEA Lab at IIT Gandhinagar. When free, you may find me making content for my YouTube channel named Explained [Don't forget to Subscribe:)] or watching Japanese language videos.
